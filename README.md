# FakeNewsPredictor
Final NLP project as part of the DIKU course DataScience. We have tried different ML algortihms to classify newsarticles as fake or real. Along with different ML algos we have also applied different text encodings such as Word2vec and TF-IDF.
The models have been trained and tested on the [Fake news corpus] (https://github.com/several27/FakeNewsCorpus). Furthermore performance on the [LIAR dataset] (https://metatext.io/datasets/liar-dataset) has been conducted but without sucess.
